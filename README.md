<h1 align="center">üì¶ declpm - Declarative Package Management Made Easy üöÄ</h1>

---

## ‚ú® Quick Start

1. **Install Requirements**  
   Make sure you have Python 3 available and the required package manager (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, SUSE, Alpine).

2. **Prepare Your Package List**  
   Create a `config.conf` file (or any text file) with a list of packages you want installed, one per line.  
   Example:
   ```
   vim
   git
   curl
   ```

   You can split your package lists into multiple files and include them:
   ```
   # config.conf
   @include devtools.conf
   htop
   ```
   ```
   # devtools.conf
   gcc
   gdb
   ```

3. **Run declpm**  
   ```bash
   python3 declpm.py config.conf
   ```

   - The script detects your system's package manager and installs/removes packages to match your config.
   - Supported managers: `pacman` (Arch), `apt-get` (Ubuntu), `dnf` (Fedora), `yum` (RHEL), `zypper` (SUSE), `apk` (Alpine).

4. **State Tracking**  
   - declpm keeps track of installed packages in your `$XDG_STATE_HOME/package-mon` file.
   - On each run, it will remove packages not present in your config, keeping your system declarative!
